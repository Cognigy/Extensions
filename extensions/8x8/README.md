## Node: Test condition of queue

This node allows you to check the condition of a queue before entering a queue. It provides a set of conditions

3. There are NO agents - The following options are presented when you enable the condition:
  * Available
  * Available or Busy
  * Available, busy, or working offline
  * Available, busy, working offline, or on break
  * Logged in (assigned but may not be enabled)

To evaluate the condition of a selected queue and then route the interaction based on the test results of that performance, enable one or all of the following tests:
1. The number of interactions waiting ahead of this interaction is greater than - enter the number of interactions
2. There is an interaction in this queue that has been waiting longer than - enter the number of seconds
