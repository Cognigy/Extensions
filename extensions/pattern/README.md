# Overview
Pattern matching Node for compound slots in Cognigy.AI.

You can define patters which will be searched for in the input text or the alternate text which was provided. If a pattern is found, a compoundSlot group will be created in the input object.

## Patterns
Patterns can be any text and can contain references to slots by using the `@` symbol. 

Example: `@color @product`

A text like `I need a green shirt` would find the compound slot group and assign color = green and product = shirt

### Tags
Slots can be tagged in a pattern to be easier identifiable later.

Example: `from @city>origin to @city>destination`

A text like `I want to go from DÃ¼sseldorf to Tokyo` would find a compound group with origin and destination set.

**Example**

Text: `I want to fly from bErlin to los angEles at 3 or 4 tomorrow if its 30 degrees and I am 22 years old 100%`

Pattern: `from @city>origin to @city>destination at @NUMBER>time or @NUMBER>atime @DATE>date if its @TEMPERATURE>celsius degrees and I am @AGE>userage years old @PERCENTAGE>perc`

Result:
