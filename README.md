# Cognigy Extensions

In [Cognigy.AI](https://cognigy.com/product/), so-called [Flows](https://docs.cognigy.com/docs/flow) are used to build Conversational.AI. There, it could be the case that one needs to integrate a third-party system to store or retreive data. Extensions enable anyone to build JavaScript modules and to expose them as [Flow Nodes](https://docs.cognigy.com/docs/general-usage-information) within Cognigy. There are no restrictions on node modules ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)) or functionality.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code of existing modules which can be used as blueprints for further developments. Therefore, all of them are provided under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).

## Approval Process

If you want us to approve your Extension, please note the following approval process:

1. Add a `README.md` to your module and describe all nodes in detail.
2. Check your code for hardcoded passwords, tokens or outdated JavaScript/TypeScript usage (e.g. `var foo;`).
3. Create a new Pull Request for your Extension feature branch.
4. Send all information and data, which are required to use the Extension, to the following E-Mail address:

**Important:** \
Please note, that Cogngiy does not provide enterprise support for developed Extensions. This repository is licensed under MIT, in which the community is responsible for the shared modules. If you found a bug or want to improve yet developed functionalities, please don't hesitate to create a branch.

### Create a new Extension or fix a bug

In order to create a new Extension, please create a new feature branch:

- `git checkout -b feature/<your-feature>`

If you want to fix an existing module, please create a bug branch:

- `git checkout -b bug/<module-name>`

## New Feature Request

Next to the already published integrations, there are a lot of third-party systems out there that could be integrated into Cognigy.AI 4.0 in the future as well. Therefore, one can follow these steps to request a new Extension if there are no developer resources to develop it on their own:

1. [Check if there is a branch that already implements your requested Extension / feature](https://github.com/Cognigy/Extensions/branches)
2. [Create a new Feature Request](https://github.com/Cognigy/Extensions/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
