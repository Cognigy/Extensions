The Microsoft Extension enables the Cognigy.AI virtual agent to login a user to a specific **Microsoft Azure Directory Tenant**. With this login process in mind, the virtual agent is now able to use the **[Microsoft Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer)** in order to execute multiple functions. In a chat conversation, the user now can be greeted with their real name, schedule new meeting in their calendar, send a message to a teams channel and more.
