# Signal CXone

This extension is a custom Cognigy extension that allows you to send signals to the CXone API to either escalate a conversation to an agent or end the conversation. It handles authentication by first retrieving a CXone bearer token using your credentials, then performing the desired action via the CXone API. Additionally, for voice interactions, it can post the transcript of the conversation to the Transcript Management System (TMS), if "Get Transcript" tool node is placed above this extension in a flow.

## Features

Sends a signal to CXone API to:

Escalate the conversation to a live agent

End the conversation

Posts voice conversation transcripts to TMS (Transcript Management System)

Voice: The OnSignal Studio action will receive the signal with an "Escalate" or "End" parameter.

Chat: Studio will make the decision based on the returned data.

Returns data: {"Intent":"Escalate"} or {"Intent":"End"}, which CXone Studio can use to either escalate to an agent or end the conversation in Chat, based on the customPayloadFromBot.scriptPayloads property in Studio.

### Node: Send Signal
