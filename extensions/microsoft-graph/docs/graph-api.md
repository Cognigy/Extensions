# Use the Graph API

After storing the Access Token (`access_token`) into the Cognigy Context, the AI is ready to call Graph API functions by adding the specific nodes to a Flow.

- Access the token via Cognigy Script:  `{{context.microsoft.auth.access_token}}`

## Node: Get User Details

**Scope:**

- user.read

This node gets the details of the Microsoft user in the Active Directory. The result looks like the following:

```json
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity",
    "businessPhones": [],
    "displayName": "Alexander Teusz",
    "givenName": "Alexander",
    "jobTitle": null,
    "mail": "a.teusz@cognigy.com",
    "mobilePhone": null,
    "officeLocation": null,
    "preferredLanguage": "de-DE",
    "surname": "Teusz",
    "userPrincipalName": "a.teusz@cognigy.com",
    "id": "..."
}
```

With this information, the virtual agent can greet the user. An example Say Node configuration could be the following:

- "Hello `{{context.microsoft.user.displayName}}`. How are you today."
- "You are logged in with the email address `{{context.microsoft.user.mail}}`"

## Node: Outlook Calendar - Schedule Meeting

**Scope:**

- Calendars.ReadWrite

With this Flow node, the virtual agent can automatically schedule a meeting in the user's **Outlook Calendar** and invite others to this event.

## Node: Microsoft Teams - Send Channel Message

**Scope:**

- ChannelMessage.Send

This Flow nodes sends an HTML message to a specific Microsoft Teams channel (`channelId` ([Read More](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-joinedteams?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http))) in a team (`teamId` ([Read More](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/channel-list?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http))). In order to do so, one needs to add the following permission scope in the authentication nodes:

## Node: Microsoft To Do - Get To Do Lists

**Scope:**

- Tasks.ReadWrite

This node can be used in order to get all available **To Do** lists for the logged in user. The result will look similar to this:

```json
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users('753d322c-224a-42da-88cd-7027c8bbcd0d')/todo/lists",
    "value": [
        {
            "@odata.etag": "...",
            "displayName": "My Tasks",
            "isOwner": true,
            "isShared": false,
            "wellknownListName": "myTasks",
            "id": "AAMkAGM0..."
        }
    ]
}
```

## Node: Microsoft To Do - Create To Do

**Scope:**

- Tasks.ReadWrite

After, for example, using the **Get To Do Lists** node, the virtual agent can create a new **task** inside one of the available lists. Therefore, the `listId` and the `title` need to be configured. Additionally, the `importance` and `description` (HTML) can be added. As soon as the node was executed, the task is added to the list.

## Node: Outlook - Send Mail

**Scope:**

- Mail.Send

With this node, Cognigy.AI can send an email with the currently logged in Microsoft user without providing further SMTP information. In order to do so, the following information need to be configured:

1. Subject
2. Message
3. List of Recipients
4. (opional) List of CC Recipients
